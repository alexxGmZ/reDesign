<h1 align="center">reDesign</h1>

A rewrite of the HTML Canvas Graphics creator called **Designer** from the
[MenuMaApp Manage](https://github.com/alexxGmZ/MenuMaApp/tree/main/Manage)
application. The goal is to make the feature a standalone Electron application.

The application was inspired by the simplicity of [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
